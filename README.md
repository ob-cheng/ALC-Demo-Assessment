## Q: Why using Github rather than sharing Power BI link?
A: To share Power BI dashboard outside of the organization, it **required purchase of Power BI Premium which I do not have at the moment.**

Considering that the recruiter may not have the same organization account, and for the purpose of avoiding inconvenience, I uploaded the BI dashboard file to GitHub so that the recruiter may download and view it locally for assessment purpose. 

**Please find and download the pbix file at the link: https://github.com/ob-cheng/Alcon-Demo/blob/main/Tianen_Cheng_Alcon_Demo.pbix**

My apology for the inconvience. And I will begin learning Tableau to avoid more situations like this. 
## SQL script
You may also find the SQL script I used to answer the assessment interesting. 

Please look at https://github.com/ob-cheng/Alcon-Demo/blob/main/alcon_demo.sql.
